<h1>Home Page</h1>
  <p>Hello!!! Welcome to my personal website. I dont really know what exactly I should put here so I think I'll just say a bit about myself.</p><br>

<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>My name is Toney. I am a sophemore at the Illinois Insitute of Technology majoring in Applied Cybersecurity and IT. I am involved in a few student orgs including Navy ROTC, D3 Track & Field, and I am a member of the Alpha Epsilon chapter of the Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity</p><br>

<h2>Hobbies right now</h2>
  <p>I used to have a ton of hobbies back in high school, but have had to cut most of them out of my life to stay on track with academics.</p>
  <p>As of right now, I really only find myself lifting, running, or playing pool in my free time. I also love to just walk around the city, but I allmost never get the oppertunity anymore.</p><br>
  
<h2>Hobbies in the past</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Video Games:<br><p>In the past I have been really into playing video games. Unfortunatly I dont know where I'd even start back in those anymore.</p>
